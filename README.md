# EECS-368-dots-boxes
EECS 368 js project, Sam Gilchrist

Dots and Boxes:



HOW TO PLAY: 
Players alternate placing dots through clicking on a 5x5 board of 2x2 boxes, attempting to score by placing the last dot in 
each 2x2 box. A player goes an extra turn whenever they score. Game ends and winner is determined when a player reaches a match score of 13.


IMPORTANT:
Some functions were referenced from my previous Gomoku group project from EECS 448 (taken this semester), and they are pre-commented as such in the files. These functions are "drawDots" (used to draw the dots on screen instead of using images), "drawline" (used to draw lines on the board), "newgame" (used to reset the field array), the click event listener (used to accurately place the dots on the board based on the mouse's position), and some of the score tracking implementation in scoreboard.js, which uses arrays to keep track of the separate scores for the two players. All other code is newly written by me for this project.
